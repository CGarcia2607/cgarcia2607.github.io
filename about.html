        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello. My name is Christopher Garcia, I'm currently a senior in Belen Jesuit Preparatory School. I enjoy basketball, history, music, and video games. My favorite shows are Cyberpunk and Breaking Bad as both show a main character who becomes too overconfident in what they do and end up losing everything including the reason for the path they take. I am currently working on a project that deals with solving wrist pain specifically on wrist pain caused by simple tasks such as writing and typing. I am working on this project with a group of people who wish to fix this minor inconvenience in our lives as students. </p>
