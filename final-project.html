        <p>According to studies recorded by the National Institute of Health over 30% of frequent writers, including students and professionals, report experiencing wrist discomfort or strain due to excessive pressure during extended handwriting sessions. This issue has been documented over the past decade and affects a significant number of individuals in academic and professional environments all around the world.

        <p>We worded the problem this way to put emphasis on the frequency of wrist pain during the process of writing, and how it can be caused in something simple we do daily. This problem has been reviewed by many such as E.S. Ferguson's "Repetitive Strain Injury: A Computer User's Guide" which details how actions like handwriting lead to strains. The National Institute of Health has also done research on wrist strain being caused by simple daily actions such as using an iphone.
